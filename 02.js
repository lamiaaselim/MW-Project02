  Promise Intro And Syntax
  - Promise In JavaScript Is Like Promise In Real Life
  - Promise Is Something That Will Happen In The Future
  - Promise Avoid Callback Hell
  - Promise Is The Object That Represent The Status Of An Asynchronous Operation And Its Resulting Value

  - Promise Status
  --- Pending: Initial State
  --- Fulfilled: Completed Successfully
  --- Rejected: Failed

  Story
  - Once A Promise Has Been Called, It Will Start In A Pending State
  - The Created Promise Will Eventually End In A Resolved State Or In A Rejected State
  - Calling The Callback Functions (Passed To Then And Catch) Upon Finishing.

  - Then
  --- Takes 2 Optional Arguments [Callback For Success Or Failure] chain
